#### A neuron-busting exercise from Epicodus to see where I'm at with things, 6/4/19

#### By **Anise Lester**

## Description

Have fun selecting fixed data, just as you would with a quiz. Ready to find out what kind of dragon you are?

## Setup

* Take this ( https://github.com/M00nDrag0n/CodingAssessment-2.git ) repository and clone it on Desktop
* open the repository, you will see a file called "index.html". Double click "index.html".
* The file should then show up on Google Chrome (or whatever browser you're using)
* Fill in data and see what result you get!

* Please note that this is a VERY simple quiz. Do not overthink your results.
